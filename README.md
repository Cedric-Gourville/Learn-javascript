# Warm-up

First advice, take a look to [codewars](http://www.codewars.com/), I think it's a good things to have when you want to start coding.
It allows you to learn new concept, use google, stackoverflow ect...and it's kind of funny. You can also compare you solution to other code warriors. I use it since a few days and I learned a lot.



# New Concepts Learned

//-----Variables + Functions----//

    ----> Create a greeting function that takes your name from a variable and displays a greeting to you on the page.
    
    
//-----Click handling + changing a class----//

    ----> Create a “more information” button that makes a blurb of information appear or disappear. Also, try creating two theme selection  buttons. When you click either one of them, a bunch of stuff on the page changes colors and styles to fit a theme.
    
//-----Get a text input value, JavaScript arithmetic----//

    ----> Create a restaurant tip calculator.
    
//-----Arrays, loops----//

    ----> Create the front end of a social posting site. Use an array to hold a list of text posts. Loop through that array to display the  posts.
